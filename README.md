# Twitter Loader for IBM Bluemix

## Description 
This is a fork of Twitter Loader project for IBM Bluemix. 

This project contains a ready to use application that allows you to query data from IBM Insights for Twitter service and load the results into a table in dashDB.

This modification collects one thousand Tweets as well as adding additional features for each Tweet. 

## Get Started
Deploy the app under your Bluemix account. You run a sample query like `"term" posted:2015-12-01,2015-12-31 -RT`. Visit [Getting started with Insights for Twitter](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/Twitter/index.html#query_lang) for more query options. Tweets are stored in IBM dashDB.
